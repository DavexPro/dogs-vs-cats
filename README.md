## Dogs Vs. Cats

Competition: [Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)

This Repo is a kind of framework tutorial, I used both Keras and PyTorch to do transfer learning.

For Keras, there are different score, which you can pay a visit to `keras_transfer_learning` notebook.

For PyTorch, I use ResNet-152 to do the transfer learning which is easy to do, and get `0.05304` score as test result.
